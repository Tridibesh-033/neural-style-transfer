# Neural Style Transfer with TensorFlow

This project implements Neural Style Transfer (NST) using both:
1. **Custom VGG19-based approach**
2. **Pre-trained TensorFlow Hub model**

### The goal is to stylize a content image using the patterns from a style image.


## How It Works

- Uses TensorFlow and VGG19 to extract features from content and style images.
- Optimizes a generated image to combine the content and style representations.
- Optionally uses a ready-made model from [TensorFlow Hub]

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- PIL
- Matplotlib
- Streamlit (for future deployment)


## Future Goals

- [ ] ✅ Add GUI with Streamlit.
- [ ] ✅ Deploy on [Streamlit Cloud]
